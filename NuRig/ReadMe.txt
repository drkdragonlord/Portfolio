NuRig Read Me

The NuRig script was an idea I(Juan Borrero) created prior to the creation of Maya's Full Body IK solution. After several years working with the team at Radiant Square and Jaibana Studios creators of FinalRig. This tool was desigend to facilitate a modular style automated rigging creation using only procedural methods in the MEL and Maya environment. It also allowed for a user to run the several parts as stand alone functions given certain inputs. Sinve 2014 the tool has not been developed further, but it is shown here as a sample of my programming knowledge.
